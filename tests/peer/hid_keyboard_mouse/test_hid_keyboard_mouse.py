    The sketch does not start it in setup(): the peer board is flashed after this
    board has booted, and a host that is already running observes those resets
    and records the enumerations they cause as errors.

    `peers` is requested for its ordering, not its value. This fixture is autouse
    and would otherwise be set up before it, which starts the host before the peer
    upload -- putting the host back inside exactly the window the gating exists to
    avoid. Requesting `peers` moves the upload ahead of the start.

    Stopping in the teardown rather than at the end of the test body means it
    runs when the test fails or is interrupted too, so the board is not left
    hosting USB after the run.
